# Flappy-Clone

# Example Usage
  - .\src.exe ..\level.txt 148 15

# Usage
  - .\src.exe <level_file> <level_width> <level_height>
  - <level_width> and <level_height> are 1 based integers
  - <level_height> must be 15 for now as the game is 640 x 480 (32x32 tiles)

# Level
  - You can edit the level using '0' to denote barriers, '1' is used just to give reference to level boundaries
